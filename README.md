# Pong-Game-using-Cpp
The Pong Game implemented in C++ is a recreation of the classic arcade game, where two paddles and a ball simulate a table tennis match. The game is a simple yet engaging demonstration of 2D graphics, collision detection, and game mechanics.

## Key learning points
1. Movement
2. Controls
3. Collision Detection
4. Scoring
5. Artificial Intelligence

## Requirements
    1. Basic knowledge of C++
    2. VS Code
    3. Raylib (Raylib is a cross-platform, open-source software development library for creating games and graphical applications.)

## Steps to develop Pong
1. Create a blank screen & Game loop
2. Draw the paddles and the ball
3. Move the ball around
4. Check for a collision with all edges
5. Move the player's paddle
6. Move the CPU paddle with Artificial Intelligence
7. Check for a COIIieinn wi+h +hA
8. Add scoring
